# Diagonals Program

## One-Sentence Description
A Java program that calculates the number of diagonals in any polygon using the formula *n(n−3)/2*.

## Objective
This project involved creating a Java program that determines how many diagonals exist in a polygon based on the number of its sides. The program guides the user through input collection, applies the mathematical diagonal formula, and presents the final result. This project reinforced understanding of basic Java syntax, arithmetic operations, console input handling, and geometric formulas.

### Skills Learned
- Understanding of polygon geometry and the diagonal formula *n(n−3)/2*
- User input handling with Java’s `Scanner` class
- Arithmetic operations and variable manipulation
- Console-based program design and clear program flow
- Structuring a full Java application with input, processing, and output

### Tools Used
- Java JDK  
- Terminal/IDE compiler  
- Console for input/output
